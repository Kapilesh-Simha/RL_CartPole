Reinforcement Learning based CartPole GUI

This is a Reinforcement Learning project where a DQN (Deep Q-Network) agent learns to balance a pole on a moving cart — visualized using a custom Pygame GUI.

## 🧠 Features

- Trains using Deep Q-Learning
- Real-time GUI using Pygame
- Visual display of cart, pole, score, and epsilon

## 🛠 Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
